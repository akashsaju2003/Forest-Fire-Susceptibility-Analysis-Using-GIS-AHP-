Forest Fire Susceptibility Mapping Using GIS \& AHP

$ About This Project



Forest fires are a recurring environmental issue in many Himalayan regions. In this project, I used GIS and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to identify forest fire-prone areas in Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India.



The goal was to combine satellite data, terrain analysis, and climatic factors to create a scientifically structured forest fire susceptibility map. This project demonstrates how spatial analysis and multi-criteria decision-making can support disaster risk reduction and environmental planning.



$ Objective



To identify and classify forest fire susceptibility zones



To apply AHP for systematic weight assignment



To integrate remote sensing datasets within a GIS framework



To generate area statistics for each risk category



$ Study Area



Pauri Garhwal district is located in the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand. The area is characterized by steep slopes, pine-dominated forests, and dry seasonal conditions — making it vulnerable to frequent forest fires.



$ Data Used



Land Use / Land Cover (Sentinel-2)



NDVI (using raster calculator,Landsat 8 level 2, Band5-Band4)



SRTM DEM (Elevation Data)



Slope \& Aspect (Derived from DEM)



Land Surface Temperature (Landsat-8)



Rainfall Data



Wind Speed Data



All datasets were processed, reprojected, and standardized before analysis.



$ Tools \& Software



ArcGIS Pro



Spatial Analyst Tools



Raster Calculator



Microsoft Excel (for AHP weight calculation)



$ Methodology



Data collection and preprocessing



Generation of thematic layers



Reclassification using suitability scales



AHP pairwise comparison and weight calculation



Consistency Ratio validation (CR < 0.1)



Weighted overlay analysis



Classification into six susceptibility zones



Area statistics calculation



$ Results



The analysis shows that a significant portion of the district falls under moderate to high susceptibility zones. High-risk areas are mainly associated with steep slopes, dense vegetation cover, and elevated land surface temperatures.



The AHP-based weighting ensured logical consistency in factor prioritization, improving the reliability of the model.
